# Maintenance

Monitor and maintain the health of the FlopsyBot system, including processes, resources, and service availability.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "how is the system doing?" or "check system health"
- A service seems unresponsive and needs to be diagnosed
- Routine maintenance is due (log cleanup, session checks, etc.)
- A heartbeat or scheduler triggers a system health check

## How to Run Commands

Run shell commands directly via the available Bash-style command runner. Never tell the user to run commands themselves — run them yourself.

## Diagnostic Scripts

Two helper scripts live in `scripts/` alongside this skill.

### system.sh — System-Level Health

Collects OS-level metrics. Run the script directly:

    bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/system.sh

Output fields:
- `os` — Operating system
- `uptime` — System uptime
- `load` — 1, 5, 15-minute load averages
- `cpu_usage` — Current CPU usage percentage
- `cpu_cores` — Number of CPU cores
- `memory` — Used/total memory with percentage
- `swap` — Swap usage (used/total, free)
- `disk` — Disk usage on root volume
- `network` — Connectivity check: `ping=true/false dns=true/false latency=Xms`
- `battery` — Battery percentage (laptops) or `N/A`
- `---top_disk---` — Section header, followed by top 5 biggest directories in home

### process.sh — Process Monitoring

Monitor specific processes by name, PID, or port. Run the script directly:

    bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/process.sh name nginx   # By name
    bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/process.sh pid 1234     # By PID
    bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/process.sh port 8080    # By port
    bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/process.sh self         # FlopsyBot

Output fields:
- `status` — `running` or `not_running`
- `pid` — Process ID
- `cpu` — CPU usage percentage
- `mem` — Memory usage percentage
- `rss` — Resident set size in MB
- `uptime` — How long the process has been running
- `command` — The command that started the process

## Health Check Workflow

### Quick Health Check
1. Run `bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/system.sh`
2. Run `bash /skills/maintenance/scripts/process.sh self`
3. Report any anomalies (high CPU, low memory, process not running)

### Full Diagnostic
1. Run the quick health check above
2. Check log files for recent errors
3. Verify key services are reachable (e.g., can Gmail tools respond? Is Spotify connected?)
4. Check session files for expiration: `.flopsy/sessions/`
5. Report findings with recommended actions

### Routine Maintenance
- Periodically clean up old log files
- Check for and rotate large files in `.flopsy/`
- Verify OAuth tokens are not close to expiration
- Confirm heartbeat states are being updated (not stale)

## Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| CPU usage | 70% | 90% |
| Memory usage | 80% | 95% |
| Swap usage | Any swap in use | >50% swap used |
| Disk usage | 75% | 90% |
| Network (ping) | — | `ping=false` (no internet) |
| Network (DNS) | — | `dns=false` (DNS resolution broken) |
| Network (latency) | >200ms | >500ms |
| Battery | <20% | <10% |
| FlopsyBot process | Not running | Not running for 5+ minutes |

## Guidelines

- Run all commands directly via the available command runner — never tell the user to run them manually
- Run `process.sh self` first when diagnosing any issue; if the main process is down, that is the root cause
- Resource metrics are snapshots; run them multiple times to distinguish spikes from sustained issues
- Do not restart services without confirming with the user unless an automated recovery policy is in place
- Log the results of health checks so that trends can be identified over time
